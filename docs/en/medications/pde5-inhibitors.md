## What are PDE5 Inhibitors?

PDE5 inhibitors are a class of medications used primarily to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). They work by blocking the enzyme phosphodiesterase type 5, which helps maintain erections by increasing blood flow to the penis.

## How They Work

1. **Sexual stimulation** triggers release of nitric oxide (NO) in penile tissue
2. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase
3. This increases levels of cyclic GMP (cGMP)
4. cGMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow
5. PDE5 normally breaks down cGMP
6. **PDE5 inhibitors block this breakdown**, maintaining the erection

### Important: These medications DO NOT:
- Create sexual desire
- Work without sexual stimulation
- Increase penis size
- Cure ED permanently

## Safety Information

### ⚠️ Use with Caution
- Alpha-blockers (may need dose adjustment)

- Alcohol (increases side effects)
- Grapefruit juice (affects metabolism)
