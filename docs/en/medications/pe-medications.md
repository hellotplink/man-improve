- **Subjective PE**: Normal ejaculation time but perceived as premature

- **NOT approved** by FDA, EMA, or other major regulatory bodies
- **Potentially dangerous** due to unverified ingredients
- **Illegally sold** in most countries

### Common Unofficial Combinations Found in Unregulated Products

#### "Super" Products (Various Names)
Typically contain:
- PDE5 inhibitor (often sildenafil 100mg)
- Dapoxetine (often 60mg)

**Risks**:
- Fixed doses may be inappropriate for individual needs

### Market Names to Be Cautious Of:
Products with names like:
